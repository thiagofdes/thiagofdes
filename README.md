👋 Hi, I'm Thiago Fernandes

👀 I have an interest in various programming areas and am exploring different paths to find my passion in the vast world of technology.

🌱 Currently, I'm dedicating my time to learning and enhancing my programming skills. I'm excited about the possibilities that technology offers, and I'm open to discovering new areas.

💞️ I'm looking for opportunities to collaborate on interesting projects. If you're seeking help on a project or have suggestions for beginners, I'd be happy to contribute and learn together!

📫 You can reach out to me linkedin/thiagofdes or @thiagofdes_ to discuss projects, share knowledge, or just exchange ideas about programming. I'm always open to new connections and learning opportunities.
